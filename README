nessDB v1.7

  Levle-LRU
  ========
    * Level-LRU pool size is configurable(unit is byte),as with InnoDB's bufferpool
    * Inlcude new-level and old-level two levels
    * If one's hits >MAX,it will be moved to new-level,
      and if new-level is FULL,move the last items to the head of old-level
    * It's a real non-dirty shit,and likely atomic energy level transition
 
  How to do
  =========
	a, $cd src
	b, $make
	c, $./nessdb_bench add
