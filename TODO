nessDB V1.3  TODO
-----------
*1,fixed value's length for OS cache(and test it better performance?)
   have a test,1000,0000items,random get,cost 64000000 cpu's clock,more slowly than expected.
   with the fixed-length,DB file increases to 1.2G(double size of un-fixed-length),this is one  reason.
 2,implement "remove/update"
 3,capacity resize
*4,change the Index-Structure to B-Tree to save memory.
